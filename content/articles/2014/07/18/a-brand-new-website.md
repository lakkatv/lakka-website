We finally managed to remake our website with a fully static content management
system - [nanoc](https://nanoc.app). This allows us many good things.

But first of all, we wish to thank [Evolix](https://evolix.com) for offering
free hosting to this website.

## Some changes

You might have noticed new pages form the navigation bar:

* [Documentation](/doc/Home) is actually the same content in our
[Github Wiki](https://github.com/lakkatv/Lakka/wiki), actually we use the very
same source code, from the same place.
* [Contact](/contact) has changed. We temporarily removed the contact form and
replaced it by instruction to contact us. Don't worry though, it will be back
soon.
* [About](/about) contains legal and miscellaneous information.
* We also refactored the [installation tutorial](/get/) and cleaned up W3C validations
issues on it.

Of course are working on improving your walk here and by the way we would
listen to your suggestions.

Oh, and you might also have noticed, we added a “News” section.

## About Lakka itself

It has been a long time since we last released. We are working hard integrating adding
the XMB-like menu. Though it is not yet fully functional (some feature are missing).
But it is just a matter of week until we release it.

We got some prototype version, and kivutar released a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnJQa1J_v5s) on a running menu on Raspberry Pi.

PC port works just fine. We managed to play Nintendo 64 and PlayStation One games
without noticeable issues concerning frame rate.

We also started to port the system to cubieboard. It still has the RGUI menu, but we
managed to run a few roms.

Here you can get one of [those image](https://sources.lakka.tv/nightly/) if you want to
give a try. Just do not forget these are prototypes.
